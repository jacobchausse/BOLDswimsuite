    "Deterministic diffusion requires a discrete-space voxel. Rather than using Monte Carlo spins to provide the magnetic field offset samples, we use the points on a discrete grid (from the discrete voxel geometry). Unlike spins however, our samples do not diffuse through space over time, they remain on the grid. Instead, the diffusion is modelled by convolving the resulting magnetization (Mx, My) with a special kernel. In essence we are performing a no-diffusion simulation with the gridded samples, and then we apply a post processing step (kernel convolution) on the magnetization to simulate the effects of diffusion. Currently this method is implemented only for 2D geometry, so we will use that in the examples."
